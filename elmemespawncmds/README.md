# Installation of the spawn menu
Step 1: Move all of the .cfg files from the spawn menu folder to your games cfg folder
Step 2: Modify your autoexec.cfg file to include this:
`bind q "toggleconsole;exec spawnmenu"`
If autoexec.cfg doesn't exist make it inside of your cfg folder.
Step 3: Open your game, make sure cheats are on and press Q
# Using the spawn menu
You can navigate through the spawn menu using the numbers.
For example, if in this menu
`1: Vehicles`
`2: Tools`
you want to select Tools, you would have to input 2.
